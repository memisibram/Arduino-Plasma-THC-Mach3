# Arduino_Plasma_THC_Mach3
Mach3 plasma torch height control with Arduino

### About the project
This project was first shared by Phạm Duy Anh in 2016, and some corrections and updates were made by me in 2020.
Finally, in 2023, features to control the stepper motor driver were added to the project and it took its current form.
